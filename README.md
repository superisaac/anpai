engine and script support, the FEEL module can be included into
other rust projects or used as command line executable as FEEL
interpreter.

## Build
* run `cargo +nightly build` to build feel interpreter feel
* run `cargo +nightly test` to run testing

## Examples
```shell

% ./target/debug/wfkit feel -c '"hello " + "world"'
"hello world"

% ./target/debug/wfkit feel -c '(function(a, b) a + b)(5, 8)'
13

# dump AST tree instead of evaluating the script
% ./target/debug/wfkit feel -c 'bind("a", 5); if a > 3 then "larger" else "smaller"' --ast
(expr-list (call bind ["a", 5]) (if (> a 3) "larger" "smaller"))

% ./target/debug/wfkit feel -c 'some x in [3, 4, 8, 9] satisfies x % 2 = 0'
4

% ./target/debug/wfkit feel -c 'every x in [3, 4, 8, 9] satisfies x % 2 = 0'
[4, 8]
```
